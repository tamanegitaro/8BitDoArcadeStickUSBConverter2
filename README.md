## How to use
- Connect 8BitDo arcade stick 2.4G USB dongle to 8BitDo Arcade Stick USB Converter.
- Connect 8BitDo Arcade Stick USB Converter to console.
- Set 8BitDo Arcade Stick to Nintendo Switch(S) mode and 2.4G wireless mode.
- Wait 4 seconds until 8BitDo Arcade Stick gets recognized by console.
- For LS/DP/RS switch, make sure to set it as DP for mini console compatibility. You can also use LS/RS for Switch, PSx, and other consoles which utilizes LS/RS.
- For PS4/PS5 compatibility, you will need USB Hub(Experimental) and PS4/5 Authentication USB dongle.

Hotkeys:

- Hold S2 + B3 + B4 5 seconds for Firmware Upgrade mode - Bootsel (Or hold Boot button on RP2040-Zero and connect it to your PC)
- Hold S1 + B3 + B4 5 seconds for Webconfig

To change game mode, Hold Home + S1 + S2 and push button below.

- B1 : XBOX Original
- B2 : PC Engine Mini
- R2 : Neogeo mini
- L2 : EgretII mini
- B3 : PS3
- B4 : PS4
- R1 : PS CLASSIC
- L1 : Megadrive mini / Astrocity mini

This is just example of modes. You can change each button's mode by WebConfig - Settings - Boot Input Modes

## What is difference from original GP2040-CE?
- Supports input by 8BitDo Arcade stick USB dongle(Switch mode)
- Neogeo mini's button alignment is ABCD instead of BOX alignment.
- Additional 3.5 seconds boot delay when connecting to Egret II mini to prevent stuck in white when connected to 2P side.

## Known issue
- After changing game mode, sometimes need to reboot USB converter and 8BitDo arcade stick to get it recognized.

## Performance

Input latency is tested using the methodology outlined at [WydD's inputlag.science website](https://inputlag.science/controller/methodology), using the default 1000 Hz (1 ms) polling rate in the firmware. You can read more about the setup we use to conduct latency testing [HERE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Site/blob/main/latency_testing/README.md) if you are interested in testing for yourself or would just like to know more about the devices used to do the testing.

| Version | Mode         | Poll Rate | Min     | Max     | Avg     | Stdev   | % on time | %1f skip | %2f skip |

| v0.7.9  | Xinput       | 1 ms      | 0.45 ms | 1.28 ms | 0.76 ms | 0.24 ms | 98.48%    | 1.52%    | 0%       |

| v0.7.9  | Dinput (PS3) | 1 ms      | 0.44 ms | 1.27 ms | 0.75 ms | 0.24 ms | 98.49%    | 1.51%    | 0%       |
| v0.7.9  | PS4          | 1 ms      | 0.55 ms | 2.26 ms | 0.90 ms | 0.32 ms | 98.21%    | 1.79%    | 0%       |
| v0.7.9  | PS5          | 1 ms      | 0.55 ms | 2.33 ms | 0.91 ms | 0.33 ms | 98.18%    | 1.82%    | 0%       |
